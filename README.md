# w01f m00n

w01f m00n is a terminal-based forensic utility. It searches the selected 
path recursively for all or specific files and saves them in a csv file.

**the program is currently in the alpha-stage of development and is not 
yet usable!**

## The following implementations are planned:
* selection of what to search | save in the csv file (file size, user, group ...)
* text output of statistics
* graphical output of statistics as images
* deleting files with specific file extension
* deleting files with specific file names
* deleting files with specific file size
* move or copy specific files to a directory
* pack files as archive
* information about the machine (operating system, user ...)

## Perhaps to implement:
* Standalone executeable (PyInstaller?)
